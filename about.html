<p>I am a cuban software developer with more of 10 years of experience developing applications of all sort.
    I have worked mostly with Visual Basic, Asm, C/C++, Java, PHP, Python and Javascript. 
    I started studying Software Engineering in 2013 in a partial time basis, and I finished it in 2010. Afterwards,
    I started working as an independent developer, working mostly as an outsource for projects outside Cuba. 
    In 2014, I moved to Ecuador and eversince I have been working there as an outsource of north-american companies as well.
    I expect to become the developer I want to be at some point, but for that I need to continue studying a lot more.
