<p>I am a cuban software developer who lives in Ecuador. I started studying English 
in Cuba since I was 9 years old, and in June of 2017 I attained the 
<abbr title="International English Language Testing System">IELTS</abbr> exam.
During my childhood I studied Painting, Italian and even music (Bass as instrument); 
I can notice that added value to my overall culture. While doing my 12th grade I 
also got prepared to excercise as teacher of basic computing for elementary schools, 
which I did during almost 8 years, period in which I got my degree in Software Engineering. 
</p> 
<p>
At the beginning I started programming in Visual Basic. At Colledge I learned C++ and 
Object Oriented programming fundaments, using Borland C++ (very popular at the time). 
I also got some skills at the time with Assembler code, at the point I thought I would 
do my final thesis related to it (nonetheless that teacher was my tutor). At the 3rd year 
of my career I was learning to build web pages with PHP, I already knew a bit of HTML 
which was an advantage, and some Visual Basic Script: thats why I got to upgrade to 
Javascript back then. Therefore since 3rd year till the end of my career I gained a very
good experience developing websites and web applications. Thats why in my final thesis
I decided to do a single page application using CodeIgniter and ExtJS, focusing in a 
logic more controled in the client side.

After graduating in 2010 I decided to start some French studies, until I got in 2013 
a B1+ degree. 
</p> 
<p>
My first work as a  was in the prestigious University of Habana. It was an administrative job,
but I had the motivation I could start some master degree studies there, an idea I truly
loved. In a daily basis I had to travel a lot, managing people who didnt love their work,
because it was pretty boring for sure: I was the chief of the IT department of the whole
University, including its dependencies. There was when I decided to live of software
development; I quited my job and worked as a freelancer for the following 3 years. 
</p> 
<p>
While being a fulltime freelancer some friends of mine needed a hand in a freelance project 
done in Java. I did not know to much about it; I had played with Java, like I did with C# 
or Python, but a whole project using even Vaadin, a visual framework and MyBatis for 
persistence was a nice challenge back them. After some time of hands in the code, I truly 
loved it.

<p>
    In Winter of 2013 I started working on Radio Habana Cuba, having a very regular 
    IT specialist job, while working as a freelancer in my spare time. There is no way
    you can live with a salary of 35 dollars in Cuba, but at least I had an Internet 
    connection I needed. That was my last job in Cuba, until I left on September 4th of
    2014 to Quito, Ecuador.
