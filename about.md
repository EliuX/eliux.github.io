<p>
    I am living the dream of being a software developer since 2007. I speak Spanish, English and French. I used to maintain some Open Source projects which I try to maintain from time to time. Now I am the process of found my own company; Quebec and Canada needs it.
    Great Game of Thrones' fan and a dog person, altough what I have is a pretty cat called Narcos.
