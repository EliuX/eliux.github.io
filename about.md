<p>
    I am a cuban living the dream of being a software developer since 2007. I speak Spanish, English and French.
    Currently living in Qu√©bec, Canada. I have some Open Source projects which I try to maintain from time to time. That
    tells you what a great father I would be.
    Great Game of Thrones fan and a dog person.
