    I started this, my first open source project, right after creating this website.
    It allows to access to the Mega.nz API using the MEGAcmd CLI. So yes, its
    basically a wrapper. Its very useful for those who wants to use this nice 
    cloud storage service with 100 Gb of free space.

    In 2013 I started learning how to develop Android applications. 
    Then for testing my skills i decided to do this simple Android 
    game, using none third party libraries, just what came with the 
    Android SDK at the moment.
