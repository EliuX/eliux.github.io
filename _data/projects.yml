    on functional programming principles. New concepts every week and 
    at the end of each week an exam. Give a look to the *stagging*

    Before start working on Experteam S.A I was tested with this exercise

    good experience on working on multiple PHP frameworks so I could take
    this task and deliver it 24 hours later.
